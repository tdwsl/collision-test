ABOUT

This is a simple demo for collision. It uses the floor and ceil
functions and was surprisingly simple to implement. It's kinda
frustrating that I didn't figure it out sooner, as it seems like a
pretty solid solution, but I guess it's better late than never.

COMPILING

To compile, you will need the SDL2 development libs, gcc and make
